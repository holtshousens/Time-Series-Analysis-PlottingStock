# Time Series Analysis Plotting Stock

This script will run in R or in an IDE like RStudio.

What the script does:

links to yahoo finance and retrieves data for 3 stocks: LinkedIn, IBM and Tesla and uses the Time Series Analysis model to structure the data. Data is then plotted using ggplot.

In the future I will be using TSA to predict the above 3 stock prices.
